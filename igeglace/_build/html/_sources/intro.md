Protocol and experiment on granular ice 
=======================

This Jupyter Book will talk about experiment and protocol linked about granular ice. The aim is to use Digital Image Correlation (DIC) in order to highlight the dynamic recrystallisation in ice when under a continuous stress (compression). This will allow us to study the behavior of ice in ice cap.
