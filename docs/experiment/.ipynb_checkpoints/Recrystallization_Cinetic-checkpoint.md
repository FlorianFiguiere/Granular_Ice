# Study of recrystallization cinetic

In this part, we will make thin ice film from a deformed sample of ice (sample which as gone throught a creep experiment) at different time. We aim to find a recrystallization rate.

We plan on doing 4 thin ice film in one day (with AITA analysis) with the first one early in the morning and the last one close to the evening.
