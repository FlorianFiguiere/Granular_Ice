# ## Creep experiment
# 
# use Digital Image Correlation (DIC) in order to highlight the dynamic recrystallisation in ice when under a continuous stress (compression). This will allow us to study the behavior of ice in ice cap. 
# 

# Use [this link](Area_Calculator.ipynb) to obtain the theoretical weight needed for the creep experiment.
