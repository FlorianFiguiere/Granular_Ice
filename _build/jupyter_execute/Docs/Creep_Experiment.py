# # Creep experiment
# 
# ## Introduction
# 
# In this experiment, we will use Digital Image Correlation (DIC) in order to highlight the dynamic recrystallisation in ice when under a continuous stress (in compression). This will allow us to study the behavior of ice in ice cap. 
# 
# (add context of the experiment)
# 
# ## Making of the sample
# 
# - Create a sample of granular ice following [thoses steps](Build_Granular_Ice.ipynb).
# - [Machine the granular ice](Machining_Sample.ipynb) in order to obtain a cylindrical sample fitting thoses dimensions : Diameter of 55 mm, height bellow 100 mm.
# - [Create a thin ice film](Thin_Ice_Film_Making) before deformation and analyse it with [AITA](Thin_Ice_Film_AITA.ipynb).
# ## Setup of the experiment
# 
# ### Setup of the camera
# 
# ### Setup of the light
# 
# ### Setup of the enclosure
# 
# ### Last minute step
# - Measure the dimension of the sample and [determine the theoretical weight](Area_Calculator.ipynb) needed for the experiment.
# - Application of the mouchti 
# 
# ## Start of the experiment
# 
# - maintenance of the mouchti
# 
# ## End of the experiment
# 
# - mouchti and weight release
# - measure of dimension after deformation
# 
# - [Make another thin ice film](Thin_Ice_Film_Making.ipynb) after deformation and analyse it with [AITA](Thin_Ice_Film_AITA.ipynb).
# - sceal the sample for potential experiment or measure.
# 
# ## Analysis
# 
# Analysis in another notebook.

# Use [this link](Area_Calculator.ipynb) to obtain the theoretical weight needed for the creep experiment.

# The making of a thin film before the creep experiment will allow us to spot recrystallization area and compare grains orientation before and after the experiment.
