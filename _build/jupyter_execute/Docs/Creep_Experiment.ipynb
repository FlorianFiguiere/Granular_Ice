    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we will use Digital Image Correlation (DIC) in order to highlight the dynamic recrystallisation in ice when under a continuous stress (in compression). This will allow us to study the behavior of ice in ice cap. \n",
    "\n",
    "(add context of the experiment)\n",
    "The making of a thin film before the creep experiment will allow us to spot recrystallization area and compare grains orientation before and after the experiment.\n",

    "- Create a sample of granular ice following [thoses steps](Build_Granular_Ice.ipynb).\n",
