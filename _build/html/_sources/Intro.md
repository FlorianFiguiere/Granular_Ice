=======================

This Jupyter Book will talk about tools and experiment used at IGE. The aim is to list protocols, tools and experiment in one place, making researches and documentations about ice mechanics easier to find. There is below a table of content :

/!\ Make sure to read once [Warnings and advices when experimenting in cold chamber](docs/Warning_Cold_Env.md) before attempting at any of the following protocol (for the quality of the result and your security).

## Experiments
- [Creep experiment](docs/experiment/Creep_Experiment.md) : Creep experiment on granular ice.
- [Recrystallization cinetic](docs/experiment/Recrystallization_Cinetic.md) : Determination of recrystallization rate throught thin ice film from a deformed sample.

## Tools
- [Orientation mapping](docs/tools/) :  (not available yet)
- [Strain field measurement](docs/tools/DIC_General.md) : Use of Digital Image Correlation.
- [Synthesize ice](docs/tools/Synthesize_Ice.md) : How to synthesize ice from water for experiment.

## Contribute

You are welcome to contribute to the project. Here are some way to contribute to it :

1. [Submit commit](https://github.com/FlorianFiguiere/IceMecha/pulls) to fix bug or add news functionalities.
2. Repport [issues](https://github.com/FlorianFiguiere/IceMecha/issues) that you found using those tools.
3. Talk about the tools around you if you find it interesting and/or put a star on it.
