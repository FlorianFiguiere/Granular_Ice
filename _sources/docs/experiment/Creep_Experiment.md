# Creep experiment

## Introduction

In this experiment, we will use Digital Image Correlation (DIC) in order to highlight the dynamic recrystallisation in ice when under a continuous stress (in compression). This will allow us to study the behavior of ice in ice cap. 

(add context of the experiment)
The making of a thin film before the creep experiment will allow us to spot recrystallization area and compare grains orientation before and after the experiment.

## Making of the sample

- Create a sample of granular ice following [thoses steps](../tools/Synthesize_Granular_Ice.md).
- [Machine the granular ice](../tools/Machining_Sample.md) in order to obtain a cylindrical sample fitting thoses dimensions : Diameter of 55 mm, height bellow 100 mm.
- [Create a thin ice film](../tools/Thin_Ice_Film_Making.md) before deformation and analyse it with [AITA](../tools/Thin_Ice_Film_AITA.md). 

## Setup of the experiment

### Setup of the camera
For the experiment, we use a Nikon D850 with a camera lens of 180mm. Use the following settings : 
- DIC : 4 images every 10 min.
- Miror up : 3 secondes
- Rafale : 4 images.
### Setup of the light
Two LED panel are used with two other spot placed as seen on the picture above. Avoid any shadow on the sample : This can distrub the DIC.
### Setup of the enclosure

### Last minute step
- Measure the dimension of the sample and [determine the theoretical weight](../tools/Area_Calculator.ipynb) needed for the experiment.
- Application of the mouchti 

## Start of the experiment

- maintenance of the mouchti

## End of the experiment

- mouchti and weight release
- measure of dimension after deformation

- [Make another thin ice film](../tools/Thin_Ice_Film_Making.md) after deformation and analyse it with [AITA](../tools/Thin_Ice_Film_AITA.md).
- sceal the sample for potential experiment or measure.
